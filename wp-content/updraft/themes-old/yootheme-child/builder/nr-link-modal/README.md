# Example Element

Example to demonstrate a custom element for the YOOtheme Pro builder. Add this to your child theme and use it as a starter for your own custom elements.

## Install

1. Create and activate a [child theme](http://yootheme.com/pro/docs/#/child-themes) for YOOtheme Pro.
2. Inside the child theme, place this folder, so that it is located at `yootheme-child/builder/pro-element`
3. In the Builder, add a new element and select the `Example Element`
